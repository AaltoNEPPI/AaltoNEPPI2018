# Set the name of your application:
APPLICATION = AaltoNEPPI2018

# If no BOARD is found in the environment, use this default:
BOARD ?= neppi2018

# If using our custom board, need to setup this as well

# Uncomment this to disable optimizations for easier debugging:
CFLAGS_OPT ?= -O0

# This has to be the absolute path to the RIOT base directory:
RIOTBASE ?= $(CURDIR)/../RIOT

# Uncomment this to enable scheduler statistics for ps:
#CFLAGS += -DSCHEDSTATISTICS

CFLAGS += -DNRF_SDH_BLE_VS_UUID_COUNT=1

# If you want to use native with valgrind, you should recompile native
# with the target all-valgrind instead of all:
# make -B clean all-valgrind

# Uncomment this to enable code in RIOT that does safety checking
# which is not needed in a production environment but helps in the
# development process:
DEVELHELP = 1

# Change this to 0 to show compiler invocation lines by default:
# QUIET ?= 0
