This is AaltoNeppi2018 software project readme.

LAST UPDATE:
24/08/2018

NOTES:
The current 24/08/2018 build contains the speculative LF crystal fix as CFLAGS.
In case the fix turns out to be uneffective/harmful, please do remove them.

The current pin definitions are for NRF 52 DK. To define the pins for the PCB,
follow the following steps:
- In Makefile, change   -DAPA102_PARAM_DATA_PIN=GPIO_PIN\(0,3\) to
                        -DAPA102_PARAM_DATA_PIN=GPIO_PIN\(0,13\)
                and     -DAPA102_PARAM_CLK_PIN=GPIO_PIN\(0,4\)  to
                        -DAPA102_PARAM_CLK_PIN=GPIO_PIN\(0,15\)

- In ble_neppi.c, initialize the LED pin (16), as output and then redefine
  LED_CONNECTED_ON and LED_CONNECTED_OFF to setting and clearing the pin.

- MPU interrupt and i2c pins should be correct without change.
